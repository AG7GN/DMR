Version 20190518A_Anytone868-GENERIC  
# DMR Codeplug for Anytone D-868UV  
This codeplug was configured using Anytone DV868UVE Code Plug Software (CPS) version 1.33 and is intended for 868 radios.  

It can also be used on Anytone 878 radios, but be advised that 878 code plugs generally will not work on 868 radios.
## Changes since last version:
1) Updated TG lineup for Ferndale UHF repeater to reflect that it's on Brandmeister now instead of the PNW DMR network. 
2) Updated Digital Contacts list.
3) Adjusted TG line-up on zones to match the latest line-ups at pnwdigital.net.
4) Tried to name the zones so that they align to repeater names in the PNW DMR web pages, although they don't seem 
   be named consistently there.  I did the best I could. ;)
